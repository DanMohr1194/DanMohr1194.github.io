                    <li>Currently just a simple, live-updating numerical simulation of a two body system based on Kepler's laws. Paramters are included for the Sun-Earth System I plan on making an n-body version based on Newton's laws of gravitation, including visualizations and approximations based on Kepler.</li>

	    <p>I'm honestly at a loss for project ideas right now, but if you have an intersting idea for Python or R, feel free to send it to me.</p>
