    <h2>Why does your website look like it's from 1996?</h2>
        <p>It's easy to write, easy to load, and shows all the info you need.</p>
    <h2>Why planetary science?</h2>
        <p>When I was a kid, even before pre-school, I was always fascinated, perhaps even obsessed, with science. The first field I really grew to love was volcanology (I even was a volcanologist for Halloween in Kindergarten). I read a lot of books about volcanoes and geology as a kid. I also showed an interest in space from a young age. I went to Space Camp a couple of times growing up (if you're a parent reading this, SEND YOUR KIDS THERE!), and would spend hours on end reading space books or playing with Orbiter. Not only that, I also showed an interest in weather and meteorology from early on for a good portion of my childhood, meteorology was my dream job (I even came close to aiming for a PhD in atmospheric science). <br><br>Now fast forward to early 2016, I decided to take some time off of college and sort myself out. I spent a lot of time thinking about what I <i>really</i> wanted to do with my life (and not just what made me sound the coolest or smartest). I looked back on my childhood a lot and started reading papers from various fields. Planetary science drew me in more strongly than anything else; it had elemnts of astronomy, geology, and atmospheric science, the three things I've always known I love. At that point, the choice practically made itself.</p>
